DAY 79

Today's topic was  analysis and compelling visualizations of the monthly birth and death data which was wonderfully explained by Angela Yu.

What did I learn?

How to use histograms to visualize distributions

How to superimpose histograms on top of each other even when the data series have different lengths

How to use a to smooth out kinks in a histogram and visualize a distribution with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)

How to improve a KDE by specifying boundaries on the estimates

How to use Scipy and test for statistical significance by looking at p-values.

How to highlight different parts of a time series chart in Matplotib.

How to add and configure a Legend in Matplotlib.

Use NumPy's .where() function to process elements depending on a condition.

Fun Fact ðŸ¤“

The Tragic Story of Dr Semmelweis

Gather round, gather round. Now I'll tell you how our story ends. Despite the incredible evidence in favor of Dr Semmelweis' theory - that childbed fever was caused by some "substance" (which today we know as bacteria) from autopsy room corpses - was rejected by the medical community at the time. But why?! 

Part of the reason is that Semmelweis was not very tactful. He made it look like doctors were giving childbed fever to women (which they were). This is not something people want to hear.

However, he also published his data in the form of long tables without any data visualizations:

Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank MYSELF for being self-motivated throughout the lecture.
